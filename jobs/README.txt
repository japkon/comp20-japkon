This lab took around two hours to complete. Parsing through the string was very simple, most of the time was spent figuring out how to add the text in a paragraph (a different technique from what I used in the status updates lab) and styling the page. The page looks how I want it to, I was able to get each job in its own separate paragraph, with line breaks after the company name and the location of the job.
